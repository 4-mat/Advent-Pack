## A message from David

Do you know why I hate UNDERTALE? Because it's the best game ever made. The graphics look like they were drawn by a four year old with the talent of Pablo Picasso in his prime, which is what I would say if I liked the graphics, which I do....not. Narratively this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling, every choice you make weighs on your conscience because every connection you make with the characters feels organic. And that's why I'm giving this game a 5/5...billion. It fucking sucks.

### What is this?
This is the 1.3.1.X version of the SSF2 IDK, which is a reverse-engineer/decompilation of SSF2, meaning the entire game can be rebuilt from source with any changes you make, only limited by your imagination and ability to work with the game engine.

The "build" folder is the regular, playable game, compiled from the the "src" folder which contains source files meant to be manipulated and compiled with Adobe Animate.
